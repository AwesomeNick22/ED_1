Nick Boer's Matchbox Car Reflection
</h1>

<h2>

Our Process:

</h2>


<li style="font-family:verdana">
The goal was to make a replica of a toy car using the 3D printer
</li>
<li style="font-family:verdana">
First we created a to-scale engineering drawing using fine squares and calipers to measure the dimensions of our chosen car
</li>
<li style="font-family:verdana">
Then we took pictures of the three planes of the drawings and imposed them on a rectangular box on Onshape
</li>
<li style="font-family:verdana">
We drew sketches outlining the shape of the model car and removed the negative space. 
</li>
<li style="font-family:verdana">
We created wheels and other components to give the car a unique and accurate design
</li>
<li style="font-family:verdana">
We sliced our files and printed them using the 3D printer
</li>
<li style="font-family:verdana">
Finally we uploaded our pictures of the 3D printed car next to the original into a slide deck
</li>

<blockquote>
I created a fairly accurate engineering drawing. The first setback I encountered was how to create realistic curves on my rectangular prism using the spline tool. I solved this challenge by creating some small linear along with the curves to give them my ideal starting points.
	The next task was to remove the negative space. Measuring the dimensions to remove on the side of the engine (the component of the car I spent the most time on) I solved using trial and error, undoing until I got something that was roughly symmetrical. The other pieces which were somewhat difficult to extrude were the rails coming into the roof section of the car from both ends. It was hard to pan, rotate, and zoom the camera all at once but I finally found a way to positively extrude those pieces and in my opinion, it made the car look a lot better overall. 
	Finally, we had to slice the car. I didn’t use a raft for my car but I perhaps should have. The wheels were tiny in comparison to the surface area of the bottom of the car. Also, I didn’t consider that space which contains the opening to the windows needed support as well.
